During this Review, I discussed Linked Lists and addressed questions usually
received via email and during office hours.

  * **Example 1** was an implementation of Linked Lists similar to what one would
    see at the end of CS 250.
    * I briefly discussed command line arguments during this example.
    * The Linked List destructor was introduced in this example.
  * **Example 2** was a similar implementation, but with the Node struct moved
    within the scope of the Inventory class.
  * **Example 3** included a discussion of the Big-3.
    * This included a discussion of the LeakTracer utility.
  * **Example 4** covered the Copy-and-Swap Idiom.
    * I started with a brief review of how to explore an unfamiliar code.
    * I discussed the `-fsanitize` compilation flag and using the compiler to
      detect memory leaks.

This Review is split into four (3) recordings:
