I discussed two main themes in this review:

  1. ADTs as a contract and creating a complete ADT interface.
    - Read through [C++ class checklist](doc:implementingADTS).
    - **Skim** through [Abstraction with Iterators](doc:designDiscussionIterators).
  2. The abstraction provided by defining such an interface. We explored this
     by using the STL container interface as a case study.

Examples 1 through 7 were the focus. Example 8 served to motivate the need for,
based on the data-structure, a formal iterator implementation. We will revisit
the Big-3 in Review 03 (i.e., add iterators to memory-leak free codes).

The recorded review is located [here](https://youtu.be/dWcPTtZl6Gs). _Note that
this is the Fall 2017 recording._
