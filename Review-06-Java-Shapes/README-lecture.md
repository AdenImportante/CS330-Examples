This a Java version of the
[C++ Shapes Discussion](#review-6-inheritance-in-c-c-shapes-). These examples
present many of the same concepts... in the context of Java. This discussion
continues our comparison of C++ and Java.

**Note** these examples are not written in
[idiomatic](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idiomatic) Java. It is
Java code written as a transition into Java from C++. Emphasis is placed on the
mechanics of Java--as they parallel C++. (Yes, this means **I have been sloppy
with decorators**)

If you are curious about JBake... [take a look at my CS 350

  2. [Part 2](https://youtu.be/PIPNWUCqwlk) - Example 4 to Example 5
