This discussion is split into two parts:

  * Part 1 is available [here](https://youtu.be/IMGWyvyVxOE).
    * Example 1 - An example of reading keyboard input using the Java `Scanner`
      class.
    * Example 2 - An example in which the Fibonacci Sequence is computed. This
      example includes C++ and Java examples. Note the Python 3 example is
      included for comparison. You will not be tested on Python.
  * Part 2 is available [here](https://youtu.be/C8lobDIZUoY).
    * Example 3 - An example of a CS 250 level Objected Oriented Program in
      Java (instead of C++).
      - This includes a brief discussion of Gradle and JUnit as topics of
        interest.
      - Gradle and JUnit are CS 350 topics that are related to CS 330. You will
        not be graded on Gradle or JUnit in CS 330.
      - For the **truly curious**, you can access my CS 350 Review Materials
        [here](doc:Reviews350)
