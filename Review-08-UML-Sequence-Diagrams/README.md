Earlier this semester we discussed _UML Class Diagrams_ which we used to model
the things *(classes)* in a system. Now we need a method to capture flow (i.e.,
messages being passed) between *objects*.

## Whirlwind Introduction to UML Sequence Diagrams

We will start with a whirlwind introduction to UML Sequence diagrams in the
context of the [C++ Shapes Examples](#review-6-inheritance-in-c-c-shapes-)
(specifically Example 7 and Example 8).

The diagrams and markup to generate them is available in
\ExampleZip{Review-08-UML-Sequence-Diagrams.zip}

The recorded discussion is available [here](https://youtu.be/PusrbfgFfDI).


## Continuing Object Oriented Design and Analysis

The proper way to [**continue (validate & refine)**](doc:designDiscussionPart2)
an objected oriented domain model.
