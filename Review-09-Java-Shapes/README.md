# Overview

This is set of Java Shape classes used as a case study for inheritance in Java.
Topics include:

  - virtual methods
  - pure virtual (i.e, abstract) methods
  - dynamic binding
  - subtyping
  - interfaces
  - `@Override decorators`
  - lambda functions
  - Java's Stream API
  - Iterators
  - `S.O.L.I.D`


# Running the Examples

The examples can be run through Gradle using `./gradlew run`. This will:

  1. compile the Java source code
  2. build a Jar file
  3. run the compiled code with all necessary command line argument.

## Reports & Project Website

Example 6 includes JBake as a Gradle plugin. Run `./gradlew jbake` to generate
a static website with documentation and reports. Open `build/jbake/home.html`
in your web browser.
