pointer-type variable (e.g., Book* book_ptr)
reference-type variable (e.g., Book& book_rfc)
value-type variable (e.g., Book book_obj)

member function (method)

    class Book

C++ Class Checklist

    Interface completeness
    const correctness
    Big-3 (Copy Constructor, Destructor, Assignment Operator)

Inheritance
Subtyping

Dynamic Binding
virtual functions
pure virtual functions (abstract functions)

pointers
    raw pointers (the traditional pointer)
    smart pointers


New Tricks

    - Factory Pattern
    - Builder Pattern (hopefully)
    - More Iterator tricks

    - DRY & SO**L**ID with new stuff
